My name is Henok G. I'm a graduate student at the University of Colorado Denver-Computer Science Department advised 
by Prof. Gita Alaghband. My current research domain include machine learning and AI, emergent complexity, theory of 
computation, and fundamentals of consciousness and its place in all of this. 

My PhD research is about deep learning models for visual recognition tasks. For few years now, my primary research 
focus has been characterizing learning in convolutional neural networks using some existing and new techniques. This 
effor is to try and gain some insight as to how deep CCN models find useful signal from large datasets. Deep learning
models ( neural networks in general) are a type of artificial intelligence (AI) architectures that are modeled after 
the brain. Although the modeling is up for debate these are promissing algorithms that have demonstrated exceptional 
performance at dealing with complex, high volume and variety real-world data. Unfortunetly, these networks are as opaque
as the brain itself. Much like the brain, they do not store what they have learned in digital memory
in raw or compressed format. Instead they defuse the information in a way that is difficult to decipher. However, one 
can utilize the knowldge of the inividial components and operations in the architecture. For instance, CNNs are mainly
composed of convolutional, activation, pooling and fully connected layers. Given that the networks perform these small
operations in descrete and localized section of the input, we can try and controll how the input is fed to the network
and observe and analysize the output and how the output correlates with operations themselves.
