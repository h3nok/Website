I'm a graduate student at the University of Colorado Denver Computer Science Department advised by Prof. Gita Alaghband.
I'm interested in deep learning models for visual recognition tasks. My primary research focus is characterizing deep
learning blackbox to gain insight as to how these models find useful signal from large amounts of data. Deep learning
models ( neural networks in general) are a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that are modeled on the brain. These
are promissing algorithms that have demonstrated exceptional performance at dealing with complex, high volume and
variety real-world data. Unfortunetly, these networks are as opaque as the brain itself. These models, much like the
brain, do not store what they have learned in digital memory in raw or compressed format. Instead they defuse the
information in a way that is difficult to decipher.
