				<h2>A new model of reality that represents consciousness as a digital system engaged in entropy reduction</h2>
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p style="size=24px">
					<big>
						<a href="">Consciousness</a> is digital. Consciousness is an <a>information system</a>. Consciousness is an <a href=""><u>interpreter</u></a>.
						You are a consciousness.You are a unit of consciousness amongst many. The universe (or more generally any reality) is statistically
						computed virtual reality. Consciousness streams and interprets data. Consciousness is a multi-faceted sequential interpreter having
						functions such as streaming and synthesizing data. Consciousness builds its world view from data. Consciousness paints personalities
						from data. Consciousness evolves by reducing its entropy, where entropy is a measure of randomness of a given information system. A high
						entropy information system has more random processes than those processes that produce consistent profitable content. Hence,
						high entropy systems like consciousness are susceptible to de-evolution and ultimately disappearance (going back to randomness).
						High entropy consciousness has low chance of survival while low entropy consciousness can propagate itself by bootstrapping
						process towards a more resilient and fault tolerant configuration (evolve). Evolution of consciousness is enabled by a most fundamental
						process we know as awareness. Awareness is an emergent phenomenon that can be described as an ability to discern between at least two
						distinct states. We as individuals and collectives are components of a larger system with similar attributes
						and take part in such an optimization effort by playing decision games within an evolving virtual physical reality (VPRG) whose
						starting point is synonymous to a big digital bang (BDB). BDB is a metaphor that describes the conception of an open-ended computation
						process within a constrained environment having pre-specified initial conditions and a finite set of data points whose interactions
						are governed by rules of computation like those recipes found in Physics and Mathematics. A consciousness unit has an open-ended
						potential dictated by discrete choices and a decision space that is a function of the unitsâ€™ capabilities. The ever-unquenched
						human thirst to become more is an experience that describes the attitude necessary for the survival of consciousness. Love, moral,
						and ethical values are utilities to reduce collective entropy and allow for sustainability and evolution of a complex social system.
						These values align with the rule-sets by which communication between individual and groups of individuals is optimal. The outcome of
						Love-based , cooperative society of consciousness units is a resilient, low entropy social configuration, while one that is based
						on values opposite to Love are susceptible to
						disappearance.
