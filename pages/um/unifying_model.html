					Desclaimer: Many of the concepts discussed here come from a life-long personal reserach, observations, analysis, synthesis
					and experiments. Although the framework is simple the implications are significant. As a result we anticipate readers
					to be familiar with basic concepts of computing, signals and signal processing, information theory, math as well as
					physical sciences. The following are topics covered in this comprehensive evolving theory:
					<ul>
						<li>Where are we with our search for unified model of reality?</li>
						<li>Why has physics and any form of objective causal formalism failed to explain the nature of human experiance?</li>
						<li>The term 'consciousness', which we use to descirbe aspects of human ability and experiences, is digital.</li>
						<li>Consciousness is the only thing that is fundamental</li>
						<li>Consciousness is a digital system, reality is virtual information.</li>
						<li>Consciousness seeks to optimize itself to attain better states of existance by reducing entropy.</li>
						<li>Entropy reduction is equivalent to more meaning and content.</li>
						<li>Reality is virtual information interpreted by counsciousnessa.</li>
						<li>Reality is orchastrated by a larger system.</li>
						<li>Some of the sciences we consider fundamental (natural, and formal) are interpretation of rules of computation.</li>
						<li>The physical reality is a simulation rendered by the larger system in response to descisions.</li>
						<li>Science without open minded approach is sudo-science as that tends to create belief system which the consciousness
							references.</li>
						<li>Consciousness consumes data and builds itself by learning how to interpret data. No limit.</li>
						<li>Consciousness seeks novelty. Hence, no belief or disbelief. Only openmind with skeptisism.</li>
						<li>A logical case for caring, love and respect that arise from this framework.</li>
						<li>All the above is measureable.</li>
					</ul>
